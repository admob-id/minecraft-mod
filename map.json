There are even pigs to make it harder for the seeker to find the hider and for both players to move around. It's even more fun if you activate the Mob Disguiser Addon for this map.\n"

Then step on the correct pressure plate to be led to the starting area.\n\nAs soon as it begins the robbers will have to try and find a way out of prison.

It is formed by the City of Democratia and the City of Hollywoodenplank.\n\nThe State of Democratia consists of three cities:\n\n1. The City of Democratia, est. since January 14th 2014, is the most urbanized city within the state. It has almost everything that exist in real life: from hospitals to schools, universities, government offices, airports, TV Broadcast, stock exchange and many more. In this update, nearly half of the city was demolished and rebuilt with a more modern, and realistic style.\n\n2. The City of Hollywoodenplank, est. since November 5th, 2014, is a located in a mesa biome on an island several hundred meters away from Democratia. Hollywoodenplank consists of an industrial area that exports cactus, crops, and tools, a Suburban area that consists of lots of little houses, and an Uptown area, with lots and lots of residential buildings.\n\n3. The City of Queensland, est. since June 19th 2015, when Oasis Bridge has been established in update v3.6. The City of Queensland was formerly known as Oasis, and was founded mainly due to the discovery of Queensland Village, formerly Oasis Town, a naturally generated double-village. In the last update, urbanization in Downtown Queensland allowed the creation of realistic elements of an actual city, for instance, hospitals, railway stations, a Federal Building, an embassy and more to come.\n\n# Creator\n\n\u2022 Twitter: @PeacelandGov\n\u2022 Facebook Page: @PeacelandGov\n"

    "text": "SG Cloudy Warfare is the latest and greatest creation from the SkyGames team. It\u2019s a minigame and PvP map which features several modes and maps included in one single world download.\n\n# What's new in v2?\n\n\u2022 New map: Apocalyptic\n\u2022 New textures - Danger Bat, Machete, Mallet, Stop Sign, Crowbar, Damage Gun (75% Damage)\n\u2022 Fixed Bandages\n\u2022 Fixed CTF\n\u2022 Fixed Guns (Leveled Damage)\n\u2022 Fixed Chests not Filling (Still kind of working, Some chests may not fill properly!)\n\n# Modes\n\n\u2022 Free For All\n\nStart the game by randomly teleporting into the selected arena! Fight your friends to the death, the last man standing wins!\n\n\u2022 Team Deathmatch\n\nBegin at your team's base and fight it out to kill the enemy! Each team has 15 lives all together, if you kill an enemy their team's life points will go down by 1. If the other team reaches 0/15 lives, You win!\n\n\u2022 Bomb Defusal\n\nBegin in your team's base. One random criminal will be selected to carry the 'C4 Bomb'. Their job is to place it at the enemy's base (Blue Circle)! Once placed there will be a 30 second countdown until the C4 explodes! The criminals must protect the bomb whilst the cops have to defuse the bomb (Stand on the bomb for around 3-5 seconds, A beeping noise can be heard when you defuse the bomb!). The criminals can also win by killing all the cops. The cops can also win by killing all criminals or killing the player holding the C4 (The C4 holder's name is announced at the start of the game).\n\n\u2022 Take-Over\n\nBegin in even teams at your home bases. Kill the other players to get them on your team! You can also die and switch teams so watch out! The game ends when all players are on one team!\n\n\u2022 Infection\n\nBegin with 1 Cop and all the other players as Criminals. All criminals must survive for 4 minutes. If a criminal dies they become a cop and cannot return to the criminal team! The criminals win when the time runs out, or the cops win when all players are on the cops team!\n\n\u2022 CTF\n\nCapture the Flag is a fun game usually made for 4 players! Run to the enemy base to capture the flag and return it to your base!\n\n\n# Maps\n\n\u2022 Sandstorm\n\nA very good arena for Team minigames as it has a lot of open spaces and buildings. This arena is build with a theme of Red/Orange war zones. There are loads of spawn points and many chests!\n\n\u2022 Festival\n\nAn extremely good map for Take-Over or minigames that require open spaces! There are a lot of houses and a large mid. This theme was based off of the first 'Minigame Festival' maps! There are limited spawn points and a small amount of chests make the game even harder!\n\n\u2022 Warzone\n\nA very complex arena using a lot of mechanics and underground hallways. Run through the hallways of the hidden underground base or battle with your friends on the top of the base! This arena is very good for Infection and Bomb Defusal!\nLoads of updates are still to come including more modes and maps! Keep and eye out little cloudies!\n\n\u2022 Spacebound\n\nA space themed map with multiple hallways that make a great game of infection or take-over!\n\n\u2022 Apocalyptic (NEW!)\n\nSurvive and Thrive in this city! Many buildings and dangerous roads. Great for FFA!\n"

But it's now dominated by a brand new Gothic cathedral in the centre of town. The towers of the cathedral are still short; it might be another hundred years or so before they are built up to full height. There's no such thing as a chimney in this town: most fireplaces are at the centre of a hall and the smoke goes out of a vent in the ceiling. The few fireplaces there are (like in the castle) have flues in the wall to let out the smoke. It's a port town, with a few ships docked in the two harbours.\n\nThere are two versions available for download.\n\n\u2022 SSPE Shaders applied version\n\u2022 Original version\n"

In one place of the map there is a huge trap. If you manage to get trapped you simply have to start over.\n\nThroughout the map there are chests which have different loot. One chest has a wolf spawn egg and some bones which means you can try and tame a wolf to gain some advantage.\n\nIf you find all the treasures, you will be stocked up to go build and explore into the surrounding infinite area. You can change it to infinite in the game menu, but open the map first to make sure it doesn't change the original map to a randomly generated one.\n\n# How to play \n\nThis is a free for all survival map. You can break blocks, place blocks, build, mine, craft, fight monsters, do multiplayer, etc. Whatever you can possibly do in MCPE is what I want you to do in this map. If you were start a new survival mode game and this is what you got, just do whatever you would do and have fun.\nTry to find all the chests and do what you want to survive.\n\n# Hints\n\n\u2022 explode the TNT\n\u2022 look for the second area in the water and dive in.\n\n# Rule\n\n\u2022 Do not play on peaceful\n"

This is when you need to place a sea lantern in the hopper on the right side of the structure. You can think of it as an energy drink.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve fed him enough food he will automatically process the food and do his business.

The game uses command blocks to give players access to several clever tools which can be used for everything from spawning a snow wall to slowing down the other player.\n\n# How to play?\n\nThis minigame requires at least two players. Each player will be equipped with four different items and the items are as following:\n\n\u2022 Bow: Main weapon\n\u2022 Fishing Rod: Switch to this item to place a snowball in front of where you\u2019re standing. When doing this you will get boots in your inventory. Do not equip the boots. They are just there to show you that the wall is on cooldown. When the cooldown is over you\u2019ll get the fishing rod back.\n\u2022 Cyan Concrete: Place it on a diamond block in your area to spawn slowing blocks in the enemy field. This is a really valuable block so make sure not to misplace it. This too has a cooldown.\n\u2022 Egg / Snowball: When throwing these items you will get invisibility for 5 seconds. This has a longer cooldown than other items.\n\n# Creator\n\n\u2022 Fizzman797, Caramellight350\n"

Place four coal blocks around the quarry. To start the quarry place a minecart with a hopper on the top of the structure on the rail track.

But that\u2019s not all, it also adds 10 new mobs to the game such as the Dalek and the Time Lords!\n\nThe TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space) is a time machine and spacecraft which you can use to travel to a whole hoop of different planets and locations. You can swap between 17 different control rooms which each got different functionalities. It\u2019s recommended to spend some time inside the TARDIS before heading out there to explore the rest of the universe.\n\n# Locations\n\n\u2022 Gallifrey\n\u2022 Skaro\n\u2022 Mondas\n\u2022 Trenzalore\n\u2022 Mars\n\u2022 The Moon\n\n# Important Notes\n\nMondas and the Moon are setup so that there will always be night when you travel there by the Tardis. It won\u2019t rain on Mars or the Moon. The haze in the far distance in the sky is a layer of glass to keep out the rain.\n\n# Other Features\n\n\u2022 All mobs have been replaced by creatures from Doctor Who (Doctor Who Mobs Pack)\n\u2022 The Tardis is a retextured Armor Stand\n\u2022 Replaced the Fishing Rod with a Sonic Screwdriver\n\n# Extra Credits\n\n\u2022 Mars Map \u2013 Terrain map by Astrokiwi\n\u2022 The Moon \u2013 Architectus moon map\n\u2022 Gallifrey Citadel, Dalek City, and the Trenzalore Graveyard\n\n# What's new in this update 7?\n\n\u2022 Added a security system back into the Tardis to prevent certain mobs from spawning inside the Tardis. Those dark rooms just became safe.\n\u2022 Added signs to the different levels of the Tardis for better navigation.\n\u2022 Re-arranged the order of the names of the grave markers at Trenzalore. The names of actors and companions are now mixed together. This was done to make adding names easier if needed.\n"

    "text": "This is a creative map based on a fictional world mixed with fantasy and medieval.\n\nLore: The small town of Garberg was always very isolated, mainly due to the fact that it was situated on a remote island isolated from the rest of the human nation. During the time of the pirate uprising, the town was cut off from supplies as pirates began raiding and sinking supply and trading ships. Consequently, the small town was facing starvation until one day, a skylander ship crash landed on the island. \n\nThe people of Garberg were initially afraid of the skylanders, but a man named Rocar saw an opportunity and made a deal with the sky captain to repair their skyship in exchange for supplies and a temporary trade agreement. After the skyship had been repaired, the sky captain came back as promised and brought not only more goods to trade, but three other skyships, one of which belonged to the skylord. The skylord was quick to present a treaty to the settlement which he then took to the human capital. After the capital agreed to the treaty, the skylanders then helped to destroy the pirate uprising, therefore ensuring that trade and prosperity would reign between the two nations for many decades to come. \n\n# Creators\n\n\u2022 Original Map: lemonny3663\n\u2022 Ported by: souhail3907\n\nThere are two versions available for download.\n\n\u2022 Simple Shaders applied version\n\u2022 Original version\n"

The primary challenge include parkour but it\u2019s really an adventure map with a consistent story.\n\n# Story\n\nA mad scientist. That\u2019s what they called you and that\u2019s why you ended up in a jail cell in some dungeon. For the last couple of weeks, previous to your imprisonment, had you been experimenting with block manipulation. Your latest discovery included the possibility to make blocks float and appear out of nowhere. The government didn\u2019t like what you did so they sent you to a jail cell.\n\nThe odd thing about this is that your were good friend with the king but by your understanding the king had nothing to do with the order to put you in jail nor was he at the trial. Where is he?\n\nAnyways, the guards who had been your only friends to talk with for the last couple of days have disappeared. They had to go up and see what\u2019s going on after hearing some explosions. What could have happened?\n"

In this minigame you will need at least two players. One who will act as the baby and the other who will act as the clueless father trying to do his best to keep his baby alive for as long as possible.\n\nHow to play?\n\nTo be able to play the minigame you will need at least two players. Here are the objectives for each player:\n\n\u2022 Baby : Try to kill yourself (yes, it sounds horrific but it\u2019s just a fun game, don\u2019t take it too seriously!)\n\u2022 Daddy : Keep your baby alive! Basically keep it from danger.\nOnce both players have read the rules and instructions of the map and entered the house then the minigame begins.\n\nThere are multiple dangers scattered around the entire inside and outside of the house. Take for example this dangerous staircase.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t want your baby getting his (or her) hands on any of these items. Make sure to remove those quickly before it\u2019s too late!\n\nOur suggestion is to set a 10-15 minutes timer before the game ends. If the baby is still alive and well by then then the daddy has been successful.\n\nRules\n\u2022 Set difficulty to peaceful\n\u2022 Don\u2019t break blocks unless told to do so"

An adventure Map that will bring you all throughout the world that the humans have created!\n\n# Storyline & Rules\n\n\u2022 All located within the map so go have fun!\n\n# Backstory\n\nThis was an idea I came up with two years ago on a team called Team Flame. It was originally going to be our first major project, but like most small teams back then, it fell apart and no one really had the drive to work on it. It took me a little while to get back into it, but when I did I went hard. Basically in the time that I really went hard on building, I built the majority of the actual map. Then I got busy with school this past year and I had to put this on hold. Then when you gained the ability to change from creative mode to survival mode, plus plug PE was created I was finally able to fill the chests effectively. Then more recently this summer I did all of the busy work and built walls, the sky, and tested the map multiple times. Now finally after three years I have finished the mega project that has been through so many ups and downs! And you guys can go play it yourself!\n\n# Notes\n\n\u2022 You can just download the McWorld.\n\u2022 or if you download the McTemplate, you can reset your world by using it.\n"

With the cobblestone generator and your mad skills, this is considered the \"easy challenge.\"\n\n# Second challenge\n\nBuild an entire skyblock city. An entire skyblock city.....can you do that?  Yes.....yes you can.  The whole team at Kidsource believes in you. It's not going to be easy, but it's going to be fun...so this one is the \"epic challenge.\"\n\n# About creator\n\nEnjoy the map and be sure to check out the Kidsource channel on YouTube.

Then enter the arena and wait for all players to join. (Do not use the flint and steel yet.)\n\nAs soon as everyone have entered the arena then spread out inside the arena and start a countdown from 5. Once it has started you are supposed to set the birch wood (ceiling) on fire using the flint &amp; steel. I recommend that you set a use limit per user otherwise it will end too quickly.\n\nThe objective is to avoid getting suffocated by the sand which will come falling down from the ceiling."

Then step inside the wardrobe and press the button. Wait 10-20 seconds for it to complete the process.\n\nVending Machine: Use the levers to select which items you want to receive. Collect them in the output chest. Remember to switch off the levers when you are done.\n\nSecure Safe: The safe can be used for storing all your valuable items. It's locked by a secure code.\n\nThis is just a few examples of what the house includes. And in the future it's likely to be even more redstone creations!"

The entire map was built in survival mode by Kidsource.\n\nThere is a great cobblestone house near the main spawn point. Inside this first house, you will find tons of resources packed into chests. All of the things you need for Minecraft survival are already there! Also, there is a Nether Portal and access to a ravine.\n\nWhen you are done exploring the spawn area, find the road to the village. The road is marked with a sign, and runs just around the garden of the cobblestone house. This is a long, long road...but it eventually leads to a big village. There are things to explore along the road, too. The village features an even better cobblestone mansion, outfitted with the best equipment.

The half heart isn\u2019t visible (for unknown reasons) but if you make one wrong jump you will die. This means you\u2019ve got to act carefully when doing the parkour challenges.\n\nIt might not look as a difficult parkour map but since your health is reduced to a half heart you will quickly notice that it\u2019s much harder than what you probably thought.\n\nImportant: An addon is included in the world downloaded. Once you\u2019ve loaded the map go to the game settings and make sure that an add-on is enabled. It might be called five heart addon or something along those lines."

The map includes an addon which adds paintballs and other custom items to the map.\n\nHow to play?\nThis map requires at least two players. Once two (or more) players have entered the map then stand on the pressure plates to open the door which leads to the paintball arena.\n\nBefore starting you will need to pick up some gear, food and weapons. Use the commands as seen on the different signs in-game to equip everyone with the correct items.\n\nOnce everyone are ready it\u2019s time to enter the arena. Start a countdown from 10 before beginning a round.\n\nThe objective is to shoot the other players with paintballs (snowballs). There are also other custom items besides the paintballs which you can use to greatly improve your chances of winning."

Feed the bot by dropping food, one at a time, into the hopper. This will increase his hinger bars. Those bars will slowly decrease, so you need to keep feeding him to keep him happy. Only one bar per meter is needed to make him happy, and it will sometimes take more than one piece of food to increase the meters. Just try not to give him any food he doesn't want.\n"

It\u2019s a perfect map for anyone who enjoy monster battles or just want to improve their fighting skills. Also, it can be played by up to three players!\n\n# Classes\nAs soon as you\u2019ve entered the map and read all of the rules it\u2019s time to pick a class. Each class is different from the other so think carefully before picking one to make sure it suits your preferred fighting style.\n\n\u2022 Archer: High damage, long range, low armor\n\u2022 Blade Master: High damage, medium armor\n\u2022 Paladin: High armor, high knockback, low damage\n\n# Shop\nNext, go to the shop to see all the different things you can buy. Before being able to buy any of these items you will need to slay some monsters. The loot from monsters is used as the currency for the shop.\n\n# Arena\nBefore entering the arena make sure to create a checkpoint either by sleeping or by using the /spawnpoint text command.\n\nEach level has five monsters waves. To start one press the button on the emerald block. Then press it again after you\u2019ve completed one wave to start the next one.\n\nLook at the redstone lamps on the wall to keep track of how many waves you\u2019ve completed.\n\nYou have to complete six different floor battles before finally reaching the top of the tower where a boss is waiting for you.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to visit the shop to upgrade your gear and weapons!\n\n# Rules\n\u2022 1 \u2013 3 players\n\u2022 Play on easy, medium or hard (not peaceful!)\n\u2022 Lagging? Turn off fancy graphics, set render distance to minimum\n\u2022 Don\u2019t steal items from item frames in the shop"

It\u2019s slightly more difficult to control a horse than controlling the player (at least that\u2019s my opinion) and that makes this map quite hard actually. You can either play it in multiplayer or just play it by yourself.\n\nHow to play?\nThis map can either be played by yourself or with other players. Pick one of the horses in the stable and then meet up the other players outside at the starting line.\n\nStart a countdown from five and then start riding.\n\nThe horse track includes multiple different parkour challenges. Be careful! It\u2019s gets very hard sometimes and on certain levels failing is not an option!"

Fight your way through the other team\u2019s defense, or be stealthy and sneak your way up to the flag before stealing it. You can take the flag by destroying it with your shears item.\n\nIf you drop the block then you will automatically die. This was implemented to stop a major glitch. If you die with the flag in your inventory it will be returned to your enemy\u2019s base. Once back at your castle go back up the stairs and place it on your podium.\n\n# How to Defend\n\nAnother objective is to keep your own flag safe and making sure it isn\u2019t captured by the other team. The best position is in a tower to get the best view over your flag. But this comes with the disadvantage that it\u2019s slightly more difficult to reach the flag if someone comes and tries to steal it.\n\n# How to Gather\n\nGathering resources is essential for your team\u2019s survival. This is most noticeable if you have more than two players per team. The resources are found in caves and they include things such as coal, iron, gold, and diamond ore. Use your sword to destroy the cobweb.\n"

Follow the path of the red carpets to find the way up to the robot control tower.\n\nStart a countdown from 5 and then toggle the levers to start the robot duel. After you\u2019ve pulled the levers there is really not much else you can do other than to pray to Notch and hope for his blessings.\n\nIn this case it looks as if the blue robot won. The main reason for that is because I had to enable the levers for the yellow robot a little bit after I enabled them for the blue robot.\n\nIf you want to restart the map make sure to download the template download."

For example, you can switch the world to creative and then add a chest filled with the necessary potion bottles.\n\n# How to play?\n\nThis map requires at least two players (unless you want to compete against yourself of course). Once all players have spawned in the world make sure all of you got the following potion effects active: Speed V, Jump Boost V.\n\nThen one of you should press on the button at the redstone lamp to begin the countdown. It\u2019s entirely powered by redstone so all you have to do is just for a few seconds before starting to run.\n"

Then replace the stone pressure plate on the command block with a new one.\nYou will need to continue to step on the pressure plate to make it continue moving forward.\n\nI do not know why, but sometimes it does not work.\nIf so, follow these steps as an alternative:\n\n1. Remove the stone pressure plate above the command block.\n2. Connect the front pressure plate and command block with redstone.\n3.

Also, finally, the long awaited downtown has began and will continue to be my primary focus through the next few updates. The good news about upcoming updates is that since school is coming to an end, I will be able to make more grand updates and have them come out more frequently! Be sure to stay tuned!\n\nAnother thing is that I have finally started a YouTube called Wilzon Builder, which is currently only tours but will expand to tutorials and tips for building cities.\n\nDo note that there is both texture+shader and non-texture version, just incase the texture is too laggy for some devices.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nGabriel Paixao for the awesome shader\nExevium for the texture pack\nZeltop and JJ for help with the builds\n\nHope you guys enjoy - Wilzon\n\n* The last picture is an updated subway map to help people get around the city.\n"

Begin by first placing down the rail track. Then place the furnace on top of it. And then lastly place the minecart with hopper on the rail track.\n\nYou can now open the furnace UI (user interface) and start smelting your items. The process is slightly slower than a normal furnace, but the advantage is that you don\u2019t need any fuel.\n"

The only way that prisoners can win are by escaping but that also comes with a risk of getting killed.\n\n# How to play?\n\nThis is a multiplayer map which is recommended for 2-6 players and it\u2019s best if you can have the same amount of people on each team. In the map you can choose whether to be a guard or a prisoner.\n\n\u2022 Prisoner: As a prisoner you have to find a way to escape the prison without getting caught. If a prisoner escapes then he needs to get to the Criminal Base, get the weapons and use them to break out the remaining prisoners.\n\u2022 Guards: Guards are basically the rulers of the prison. It\u2019s up to them to decide when to let out prisoners on the yard, when it\u2019s time to eat and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended to act somewhat realistic and try to roleplay your decisions.\n"

For example, try to lead a wolf into water and you will slow it down.\n\nBeing chased by somebody is as you probably know very intensive, especially if you don\u2019t have any weapons to defend yourself. Your heart will definitely start pumping faster if you are as most folks, scared of wolves and especially being chased by them.\n\nHow to play?\n\nOpen the chest at spawn and grab some wolf spawn eggs. Use one of the eggs to spawn a wolf. If you want to make things even harder, add several wolves. When you are ready, hit the wolf and run for your life."

It works very similar to an elevator in the real world and it\u2019s also very easy to use. Just enter it and then press a button to go up or down.\n\nVault Door: It\u2019s important to keep your stuff safe. Build a vault door as the following and no one will be able to get inside! (You might wanna switch out the wool for obsidian though!)\n\nDrawbridge: This is a really useful structure for places you want to restrict to certain players only. The drawbridge can be enabled/disabled on both platforms.\n\n10000 Combination Password: This is a very secure vault system which will keep your valuable chests safe. To access through the door you need to do a whole variety of tasks.

This base also features an airlock that gives the entrance/exit a visual effect. There is even a beacon being controlled by 4 levers to fill your needs. There is also a hidden area in the bedroom, but you can only access it by turning off the lights. The Farm Area of the base has an automatic sugar cane,melon, and pumpkin farm.\n"

You knock on the door a few times and after what feels like forever finally an old man whose name apparently is Ben (which you learn later) opens.\n\nBen explains to you that you must finish the challenges given to him by the Scientist, only then will he help you escape. You settle on the agreement and start..\n"

And since it\u2019s entirely powered by redstone you can actually use it to brew potions!\n\n# Instruction\n\n\u2022 You can get the brewing ingredients from the chests.\n\u2022 Drop the ingredients in the hoppers to add the ingredients to start brewing the items.\n\u2022 Once you\u2019ve added the ingredients and something to power the brewing stand (e.g. blaze powder) then it will start working by itself.\n\u2022 To retrieve the items it looks like you need to press the \"Click to finish!\" button as this will complete the process.\n"

This is an incredibly well thought through map with a great storyline which combine past events with current happenings in the map. It was well worth the wait because it\u2019s a very enjoyable map.\n\n# Storyline\nIn the previous chapter of Mined Prison you and Drake finally managed to escape the captivity of Dr. Hanks and the Chief Warden. You have found a muddy cave in the prison and that\u2019s where you\u2019ve set up a little camp while doing some exploring.\n\nRecently you\u2019ve discovered the ruins of the old prison which was soon forgotten after the top modern Mined Prison (which by the way isn\u2019t exactly famous for being an especially lawful prison) was established. Even if you are still stuck in a part of the prison you will come across some people further on which might help bring Mined Prison to justice.\n\n# Rules\n\u2022 Don\u2019t break any blocks except clay blocks\n\u2022 Don\u2019t place blocks\n\u2022 Collect all emeralds you can find\n\n# Other Chapters\n\u2022 Mined Prison: The Beginning (Chaper 1)\n\u2022 Mined Prison: Text Subject (Chapter 2)\n\u2022 Mined Prison: Training Complete (Chapter 4)"

Great for people just trying the map, but should only be played once.\n\n\u2022 Easy\n\nSpawns 4 zombies instead of the 2, but there is no reward.\n\n\u2022 Normal\n\n\u2022 The normalest (if that's even a word) mode, that spawns in quite a few in multiple groups.\n\n\u2022 Hard\n\nSpawns over 50 zombies!\n\n\u2022 Sinister\n\nSpawns 100's of zombies that will push and shove their way through, with armor being a lot more common!\n\nThe last 2 types (Hard and Sinister) require a high-end device for a smooth experience.\n\n\n# Rules and Recommendations\n\n1. Don't play in survival or creative, only play in adventure (there is no way to replace the barriers and it will also distract the zombies and stop the game functioning right)\n2. Only play Nubs mode once! it is meant for nubs and ONLY nubs, so it shouldn't be hard to beat it.\n3. Don't give yourself gold. For the same reason you only play nubs mode once.\n\n# Know What You Get\n\nThese are the different traps in this version:\n\n\u2022 Arrow Trap: Fires an arrow.\n\u2022 Magma trap/field: covers certain areas in magma blocks.\n\u2022 Evocation Fang: Takes a bite at the zombie.\n\u2022 Splash potion: Damages zombies within its radius greatly.\n\u2022 Arrow rain: It's raining arrows!

The Good King wanted to rule the world by kind and non-violent means. The Evil King, however, wanted to rule the world by fear and cruelty.

    "text": "# Fallen Earth\n\nFallen Earth is a Hardcore Complete the Monument Map. It features over 10 unique \u201cCaverns,\u201d all hand-built Custom Terrain. The map spans an entire 256\u00d7256 world, allowing for massive exploration and discoveries to be made. The \u201cHardcore\u201d aspect comes into play throughout the entire map, often resulting in intense battles and near-death experiences in Fallen Earth\u2019s custom Mineshaft, Nether Fortress, Witch\u2019s House, and its 10 different biomes. You are also alone. Underground, in Crystalline Caverns, a hazardous cave-system filled with monsters and evil. Are you strong enough to complete the Final Monument?\n\n# Complete the Monument\n\nComplete the Monument is unlike a regular adventure map. It isn\u2019t centered around a storyline, or puzzles. It states a long-term goal from the beginning, and that is the only goal. The Final Monument will be a place you will become very familiar over time, as you collect resources and items that you are required to place in designated areas. Exploration is key. If you don\u2019t dare to venture deep into the Caverns, you will never be be able to gather the necessary materials to complete the map. Be brave.\n\n# Background\n\nFallen Earth first took shape back at the beginning of 2012. As a Map Creator who likes to stay away from Mods and WorldEdit, I dedicated myself to create something with a wide variety of Custom Terrain built exclusively by hand. Fallen Earth was the result. I had first decided that it would be yet another adventure map to add to my ever-growing collection. It was then that I ran across Vech\u2019s and InHaze. I fell in love with their work, and as you may noticed, I was inspired hugely by InHaze and his CTM Map, Crystal Caverns. Over the course of two years, Fallen Earth slowly took shape, and is now the best piece of work I \n\nEnjoy!\n"

It makes for a varying adventure with lots of different minigames to experience.\n\n# Story\nFor two weeks you\u2019ve been stuck in an isolation cell. A key twists in the keyhole and the door opens. Light lands on your face but a shadow quickly overtakes it. The first face you see isn\u2019t exactly pretty.\n\nIt\u2019s the new chief warden. Chief Warden: \u201cHow\u2019s the cell mr Smith? You getting comfy in there yet?\u201d. You can\u2019t help but grin when you look up at the enormously fat warden. Not because he looks funny, but the feeling of seeing a face after such a long time is incredible. So whether it\u2019s an ugly face or not, doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe uncontrollable grin quickly changes to a grunting and annoyed face when realizing it\u2019s the chief warden. You: \u201cWho are you?!\u201d\n\nChief Warden: \u201cI\u2019m the new chief warden. The previous one got fired so I replaced him. Now, get out of the cell. You\u2019ve done your time in there. I\u2019ve got someone I\u2019d like you to meet\u2026\u201d\n\nYou push yourself up against the wall, stumbling out of the cell.\n\n# Other Chapters\n\u2022 The Beginning (Chapter 1)\n\u2022 Secret Service (Chapter 3)\n\u2022 Training Complete (Chapter 4)\n\n# Rules\n\u2022 Don\u2019t break/place blocks unless told so\n\u2022 Change difficulty when to do so"

I chose to show Cinnabar Island post-destruction by volcano because it enabled me to build something new rather than just another town. The safari zone from RBGY remains (Baoba hasn't moved to Johto yet). All caves are explorable, though only Cerulean Cave and Victory Road are completely accurate to the games. Almost all buildings are enterable and all interiors are decorated.\n\nThe map isn't perfect; I began the map thinking I would make everything full-size to most accurately represent the games. Past Viridian City and Pewter City buildings are a bit smaller. The map is quite flat as well (though this is mainly due to the source material!). I did not make the Sevii Islands or any Johto areas yet \u2026 perhaps I'll get started on those soon!\n\nThanks to my sisters for the help with this map. Please leave feedback, we would love to hear what you think! Have fun and thanks for reading! \n\n# Features\n\n\u2022 Red's House in Pallet Town (aka the spawn point)\n\u2022 Vermillion City and the S.S.
